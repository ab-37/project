Dialogue Log
========================: Playing Act 1: The Abandoned Factory

Commander1: Kate, we've receive intelligence that an abandoned factory on the outskirts may be a front for illegal android production. Your mission is to infiltrate, confirm the intel, and collect any relevant evidence.
Kate: "Very unfortunate."
"Glad you could make it here."
Commander2: The site may be guarded by heavily armed personnel. Avoid direct confrontation unless absolutely necessary. Your priority is gathering evidence.
Commander2: Playing Act 2: Infiltration

Patrol Guard A3: Do we really have to pull night shifts in this dump? Even the rats won’t come near this place.
Patrol Guard B4: Stop bellyaching. I heard there’s an important operation going on. We can’t afford any mistakes.
BACK5: (Rustling sounds in the distance…)
Patrol Guard B6: Did you hear that?!
Patrol Guard A7: Relax, it's probably just a rat. This place is crawling with them.
Patrol Guard B8: No way! Orders are orders—nothing suspicious gets ignored!
Patrol Guard A9: Ugh, fine! I’ll go check it out. Happy now?
BACK10: (The ventilation shaft is empty, except for some rat droppings.)
Patrol Guard A11: See? You’re just paranoid—wait, what the—?!
BACK12: (A man in a detective’s coat stands by the doorway. A fallen guard lies unconscious beside him.)
Patrol Guard A13: Who the hell are you?! How did you get in here?!,
BACK14: (Before the guards can react, the man smashes the alarm system and pulls out a hacking device.)
Kate: "Sigh, it's a hassle."
BACK15: (Battle begins. Kate activates her hacking device.)
Patrol Guard A16:  the rats won’t come near this place.
Patrol Guard A16: Playing Act 3: Unfinished Androids

BACK17: (Deeper inside the factory, Kate finds a fully operational assembly line. Half-assembled androids hang from the conveyor belts, lifeless yet eerie.)
Kate: "Looks like these androids still need some work."
Commander18: Copy that. Snap some photos for analysis.
Kate: "I'll take care of it."
BACK19: (While taking photos, Kate spots a document on a nearby workstation.)
Kate: "Replacement project, understood."
BACK: (Before she can process the information, a man in a suit steps out from the shadows, his gaze filled with disdain.)
Victor: So, an enforcer, huh? You guys sure have a knack for showing up uninvited. Too bad you’re early—our product isn’t quite ready yet. But I don’t mind giving you a preview.
BACK: (Victor activates the unfinished androids.)
Victor: Go on, clean up the mess.
Kate: "Half-finished, yes."
BACK: (Kate hacks into the conveyor belt’s robotic arms to fight back.)
BACK: Playing Act 4: Overwhelmed

BACK: (Time passes... When Kate finally regains consciousness, he finds herself back at base.)
Commander: You're awake…
Commander: When we found you in the ruins, all the data you collected was gone. The only things left were you and your hacking device. What exactly happened in that factory?
BACK: (Kate remains silent for a moment.)
Kate: "Saw a lot of androids, but nothing else noteworthy."
Commander: I see. Well, get some rest—you’ve done enough.
BACK: (The commander exits the medical room.)
Victor: 'Replacement Project,'changing the world... Justice... Forget it. Thinking wont change anything. Might as well just rest for now…
Victor:
